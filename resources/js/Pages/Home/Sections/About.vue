            <p>Hi, I'm Rheanne, a Lead Software Engineer at <span class="text-rmAccent font-black">The Skills Network</span>, where I thrive at the intersection of leadership, engineering, and technical product management. My work revolves around leading impactful projects, fostering a culture of high quality code, and delivering robust features using <span class="text-rmAccent font-black">PHP</span>, <span class="text-rmAccent font-black">Laravel</span>, <span class="text-rmAccent font-black">PostgreSQL</span> and <span class="text-rmAccent font-black">Vue</span>.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about improving code quality, through edge case testing, thereby enhancing user experience and reducing technical debt in the long term. During my master's degree at the <span class="text-rmAccent font-black">University of Bath</span>, I researched the effects of gamification, which remains a personal interest of mine. I also have a passion for streamlining workflows and optimising processes through tools like <span class="text-rmAccent font-black">Jira.</span></p>
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy crafting cocktails, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen and learning new tools and technologies to stay ahead of the curve. </p>
